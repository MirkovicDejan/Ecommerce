# ecommerce

Hello! I am someone who enjoying while software developing and this is one web application which demonstarate a ecommerce.
I developed it using Java Spring Boot for backend and for database is used PostgreSQL.
In application is implemented Spring Security to authenticate and authorize users.
For frontend is used Thymeleaf for server-side HTML rendering 
combined with jQuery for dynamic frontend interactions and frontend is styled with custom CSS and Bootstrap for responsive user interface design.
Writen are also .js files specific for this application for additional funcinalities and interactions for Frontend.

The application is for now a demo version and is open source available for further research and customization according to user needs.
